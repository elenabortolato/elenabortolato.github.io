Welcome to my  webpage  

I am a post-doctoral researcher in Statistics at [University of Padova](https://stat.unipd.it) working with [Prof. Antonio Canale](https://tonycanale.github.io/). I am moving to Barcelona in fall 2024 to join  the [Department of Economics and Business at Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://sites.google.com/view/stats-upf).
